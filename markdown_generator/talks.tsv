"The effect of a counter-flow on oscillating cylinders
freely falling in a thin-gap cell."	Conference talk	talk-1	Athens, Greece	2022-14-09	Athens, Greece	https://www.erasmus.gr/microsites/1240/scientific-programme	We investigated the behaviour of heavy (aluminium and titanium) cylinders having elongation ratios L/d varying between 3 and 20 (L being the variable length of the cylinders and d = 0.8 mm their diameter) released in an ascending water flow in a thin gap cell (of thickness 1mm).
